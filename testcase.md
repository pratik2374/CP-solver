Here is the analysis of the provided C code along with appropriate test cases to validate its functionality.

### Analysis of the Code

The code implements two methods to sort an array containing only the values 0, 1, and 2:

1. **Brute Force Method**:
   - **Approach**: This method counts the occurrences of each number (0, 1, 2) and then reconstructs the array by placing all 0s first, followed by 1s, and then 2s.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) for counting and O(n) for reconstructing, resulting in an overall O(n) time complexity.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) as it uses an additional array to store the sorted result.

2. **Optimized Method**:
   - **Approach**: This method uses the Dutch National Flag algorithm, which is a three-pointer technique. It maintains three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`. The `low` pointer tracks the position where the next 0 should be placed, `mid` is the current element being evaluated, and `high` tracks where the next 2 should be placed. The algorithm runs in a single pass through the array.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) as each element is processed a constant number of times.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1) as it sorts the array in-place without using any additional space for the sorting logic.

### Test Cases

The following test cases are designed to verify the correctness of both sorting methods under various scenarios.

| Sample Input                     | Expected Output (Sorted Array) |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `[]`                             | `[]`                          |
| `[0, 0, 0]`                     | `[0, 0, 0]`                    |
| `[2, 2, 2]`                     | `[2, 2, 2]`                    |
| `[1, 1, 1]`                     | `[1, 1, 1]`                    |
| `[0, 1, 2]`                     | `[0, 1, 2]`                    |
| `[2, 1, 0]`                     | `[0, 1, 2]`                    |
| `[1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2]`           | `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`           |
| `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`           | `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`           |
| `[2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`           | `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`           |
| `[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]`| `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`|

### Explanation of Test Cases

1. **Empty Array**: Tests the handling of an empty input array.
2. **All Elements Same**: Ensures that arrays with all identical elements are handled correctly without any changes.
3. **Already Sorted**: Verifies that already sorted arrays are left unchanged.
4. **Reverse Sorted**: Tests the ability to sort arrays that are in reverse order.
5. **Mixed Elements**: Evaluates the sorting of arrays with a mix of 0s, 1s, and 2s in different orders.
6. **Large Mixed Array**: Tests performance and correctness with a larger array containing all three elements.

### Conclusion

The provided test cases cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure both the brute force and optimized sorting methods work correctly. Both algorithms should produce the same expected output for each test case, demonstrating their correctness in sorting arrays of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
