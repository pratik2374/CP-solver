The time complexity for both sorting functions is analyzed as follows:

1. **Brute Force Sort:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
     - The function first counts each element in O(n) time.
     - It then reconstructs the array in O(n) time.
     - Total time is O(n) + O(n) = O(n).
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n)
     - It creates a copy of the original array.

2. **Optimized Sort (Dutch National Flag):**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
     - Each element is processed exactly once in a single pass.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)
     - The sorting is done in-place with no additional arrays.

**Answer:**

The brute force method has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), while the optimized method also has a time complexity of O(n) but with a space complexity of O(1). Both are efficient for their respective approaches.
