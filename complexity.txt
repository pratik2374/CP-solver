The code provided consists of two sorting algorithms for an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Let's analyze the time complexity for each approach.

**Brute Force Method:**
1. **Counting Phase:** The algorithm iterates through the array once to count the occurrences of 0s, 1s, and 2s. This is O(n), where n is the number of elements.
2. **Filling Phase:** It then iterates three times over the array to place the 0s, 1s, and 2s in their respective positions. Each loop runs in O(n) time, but combined they process each element once, resulting in O(n) time.

   **Total Time Complexity:** O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

**Optimized Method (Three-Pointer Technique):**
1. The algorithm uses three pointers (low, mid, high) to sort the array in a single pass. Each element is checked once, and each operation (swap, increment/decrement pointers) is O(1).

   **Total Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Conclusion:**
Both methods achieve a time complexity of O(n), making them efficient for sorting arrays of 0s, 1s, and 2s.

**Answer:**

The brute force method has a time complexity of O(n), and the optimized method also has a time complexity of O(n). Both methods efficiently sort the array in linear time. 

The time complexities are:

- Brute Force: O(n)
- Optimized: O(n)
